# Crop-Puzzle-Game
A basic match-3 puzzle game written in Python 3.4. Make as many matches as you can within 3 minutes.

Creating a match of length 4 or more will create a seed of that crop type. These seeds will grow after four turns into a crop, activating any matches. This can be used to create otherwise impossible matches.

<h2>Controls:</h2>

Left-click a crop to select it; left click an adjacent crop to swap them.

Left-click a crop icon in the bottom right to select it as a seed to be planted, left click again to place it on the board
